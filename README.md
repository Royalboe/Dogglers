Dogglers - Starter Code
==================================

Starter code for the second independent project for Android Basics in Kotlin. This project pairs
with Unit 2 of Android Basics in Kotlin

Introduction
------------

This is the starter code for the Dogglers app project. This project is an opportunity for you to
demonstrate the concepts you learned in Unit 2 of Android Basics in Kotlin.

Pre-requisites
--------------

- Complete Unit 1 of Android Basics in Kotlin
- Complete Project 1: Lemonade App
- Complete Unit 2 of Android Basics in Kotlin

Getting Started
---------------

1. Download the starter code
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Complete the project in accordance with the app requirements


Tasks
---------------
Completing Dogglers consists of two parts:
1. Implementing the layouts for the list items
2. Implementing the adapter for the RecyclerView

Implementing the layouts requires completing the code for vertical/horizontal list items as 
well as the layout for grid list items. The files, UI components, and UI component attributes 
required to complete this task are all outlined in the codelab for this project. 

Implementing the adapter requires completing the code in the `DogCardAdapter.kt` file. In this file 
there are many TODOs outlining what needs to be done. Broadly speaking, there are three components
to completing the adapter:
1. A data set containing information on the dogs must be provided to the adapter. 
2. There are three methods required to create a RecyclerView. These methods can be found in the 
existing file, but the logic inside of them must be completed.
3. The logic inside of the constructor for the ViewHolder must be completed.

For a detailed description of how to go about completing the code for the adapter, please refer to 
the codelab.
